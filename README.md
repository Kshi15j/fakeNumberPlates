Live identification of vehicles with fake number plates using Machine Learning Algorithms

AIM
Project aims to replace the manual checking of vehicle records with an OCR plus Deep Learning based Algorithm to flag vehicles using CCTV camera feeds. This aims to increase the efficiency as well as accuracy of the work.

Project Discription
Read number plates using ANPR tools, check the database of the RTO using m-parivahan API, on the other hand predict the model of the car using Deep Learning frameworks deployed on camera feeds. We will compare the two results and in case of a mismatch alert nearby police station or headquarters for every mismatch
